Thank you for sharing your resume. I have some suggestions for you:

1. First, you can start your resume with a summary section which should include some lines about your professional background, technical skills, and achievements.

2. You should mention your work experience in the reverse-chronological order. So, in your case, I would suggest starting with your internship at TigerGraph, then move to your current job at JoinedPrice Technologies. This would make it easier for the hiring managers to see your latest job experience and know what you are currently working on.

3. In the description of your work experience, try to quantify your accomplishments by listing specific projects you worked on and highlighting the outcomes you achieved. For example, "Developed monitoring Angular component for Kafka streaming service that improved service efficiency by 20%" or "Built Resume Editor interface using VueJS that helped users to build resumes efficiently."

4. Try to customize your resume for the job you are applying for. For instance, if you are applying for a Full-Stack Developer position, provide more details about your Full-Stack project experience.

5. You can also add some bullet points under each course project that highlights specific skills you learned, tools you used, and problems you solved.

6. Lastly, consider adding a section about your extracurricular activities, especially if they relate to software development or computer science. This will help highlight your passion for the field.

Here's a tailored version of your resume:
